    Install GraphViz

    Install Maude 2.6. The easiest way is to install the pre-compiled maude for Windows  from MOMENT.

    Make sure that both 'maude' and the 'dot' tool from GraphViz are on your PATH; i.e., type

    maude --version

    dot --version

    on the command line (Run: cmd.exe). If a command cannot be found, then add its install directory to your Path; i.e., go to Control Panel -> System Properties | Advanced -> Environment Variables and edit the Path variable. If it does not yet exist, then just create a new entry called Path with its values set to the directories used for looking up executables separated by semicolons.

    Install the Haskell platform for Windows.

    Update the package database of the Haskell cabal tool

    cabal update

    and install the Tamarin prover together with all its Haskell library dependencies, which might take some time.

    cabal install tamarin-prover

    The 'tamarin-prover' executable is installed in 'YOUR USER DIR\Application Data\cabal\bin'. Add this directory to your Path variable (as described above) and call the Tamarin prover as follows.

    tamarin-prover

    This will display the possible options for calling the Tamarin prover. It also outputs the paths to the installed example protocol models and the case studies from our paper. We recommend opening the Tutorial.spthy example file in a text editor and start exploring from there. Happy proving :-)
